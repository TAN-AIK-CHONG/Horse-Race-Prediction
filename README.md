# Predict Horse Race Winner
We plan to use Linear Regression to predict the winner of a given horse race. The data can be used for sports betting.

# Abstract
Scrape data from Singapore Pools. Use data to predict race timings using Linear Regression Model and thus the implied winner of a horse race. Relevant data points include horse weight, horse age, horse trainer, barrier position, jockey, rider weight, venue, time of race and state of track.
This project is for NTU SC1015 Introduction to AI and ML course. 

# Timeline

## Week 1
Look into horse racing and data available to public
Look into scikit-learn prediction models and other examples of sports prediction

## Week 2
Data collection (scraping from web)
Data cleaning (get rid of outliers and irrelevant data columns)

## Week 3
Exploratory analysis of data

## Week 4 
Machine learning: use of scikit-learn linear regression model

## Week 5 
Continue coding until finish

## Week 6
Final touch-ups

# Data Sources
Singapore Pools

# Technologies
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) for algorithm/linear regression and data cleaning and exploratory analysis
