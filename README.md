# Predict Horse Race Winner
We plan to use Machine Learning to predict the winner of a horse race. The data can be used for sports betting.

# Abstract
We scraped past horse performance data from Singapore Turf Club. Relevant data points include horse weight, barrier position, jockey, rider weight, track, horse rating, finish time, etc.

We then used different ML models such as Multiple Linear Regression and Logistic Regression to predict a winner.

This project is for NTU SC1015 Introduction to AI and ML course. 

# Data Scraping
We scraped the data from Singapore Turf Club with Selenium.

# Data Cleaning
We removed any outliers that might affect the data. We also converted categorical data into numerical data through Label Encoding and Target Encoding so that they can be used for Regression.

# Predictive Models
We tried both Multiple Linear Regression as well as Logistic Regression models.

# Conclusion
